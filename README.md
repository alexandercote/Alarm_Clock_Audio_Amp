# Alarm_Clock
Design class project where I worked in a group of 3 to implement a music playing alarm clock using a microcontroller board.
Features included displaying time on a 7 segment display, alarm buttons, snooze, ability to change time
and volume control. 

Each subfolder has README's describing the logic behind the decision and pictures demonstrating the contents of the files.

Alarm clock functionality:
- Change the displayed time, date, and alarm time.
- LED's indicate what mode you are currently in. 
     Modes include: Time/Date/Alarm Set, Snooze, and Default.
- Display time in both 12 hour(with AM/PM indicator) and 24 hour 
  formats.
- Choose from different songs placed on the internal storage (a 
  USB drive for our purposes)
- Change the volume of the song using a knob in the center.
- Snooze the alarm both with a push button on the case, and with your 
  phone over bluetooth.
- Use of external power supply (9V battery) for louder audio output.
- Ability to disable the alarm entirely and use it as a clock.

Demonstration of the alarm clock can be found in the following video:
