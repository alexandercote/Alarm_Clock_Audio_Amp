# Alarm_Clock
Design class project where I worked in a group of 3 to implement a music playing alarm clock using a microcontroller board.
Features included displaying time on a 7 segment display, alarm buttons, snooze, ability to change time
and volume control. Gained practice with schematic capture, circuit design and simulation (using
resistors, diodes, transistors and Op-Amps), circuit prototyping on breadboards, PCB layout and routing,
basic SolidWorks design for a case and writing software for a simple real time system.
